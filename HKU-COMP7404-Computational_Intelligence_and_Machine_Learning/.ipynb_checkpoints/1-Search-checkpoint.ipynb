    "\n",
    "* Uninformed search: No information about the problem other than its definition is given\n",
    "* Informed search: A heuristic is used that leads to better overall performance in getting to the goal state\n",
    "* Local Search: Evaluate and modify a current state to move closer to a goal state\n",
    "* Constraint Satisfaction Problems: For certain types of problems we can search for solution faster by understanding states better\n",
    "* Adversarial Search: Search in the presence of an adversary\n",

    "#### Search Problem Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition** of search problem: (A solution is a sequence of actions (a plan) which transforms the start state to a goal state)\n",
    "\n",
    "* States: Details of what constitutes a state\n",
    "* Initial state: The state the agent starts in\n",
    "* Actions and transition model: Description of possible actions available; Description of what each action does (determined rather than contained uncertainty)\n",

    "  * States: (at most) One queen per column, none attacking another\n",
